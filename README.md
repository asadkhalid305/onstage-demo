## 🚀 Purpose

The Gallery showcases the flexibility and themes provided by the `onstage` package. It serves as:
1.  **A Playground:** Test different props (`theme`, `backdrop`, `allowClickOutside`) in real-time.
2.  **A Reference:** View the code implementation for various scenarios.
3.  **A Design Showcase:** Preview all 7 aesthetic presets (Glass, Midnight, Minimal, etc.).

## 🛠️ Included Scenarios

- **Interaction Modes:** Compare "Strict" (Locked) vs. "Permissive" (Click Outside to Close) behavior.
- **Backdrop Styles:** Preview "Blurred" vs. "Transparent" overlays.
- **Aesthetic Themes:** Full gallery of all built-in themes.
- **Responsive Logic:** Verified behavior for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop aspect ratios.
