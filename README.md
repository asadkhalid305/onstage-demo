- **Adjust Backdrop:** Test different overlays (Blurred, Transparent, Dark).
- **Tweak Gradients:** Switch between animated, static, or no gradients.
- **Customize Colors:** Pick any brand color (Hex) and see it apply via CSS variables.
- **Corner Radius:** Slide to adjust border radius from square (0rem) to super-rounded (2rem).
- **Export Code:** The "React Code" block updates instantly. Just click **Copy** and paste it into your app.
